**Note:**
As you navigate my system, **you might see some slip-ups** but the design of this system is meant to be flexible and ==**doesn't demand strict categorization, labeling or note-scheduling thus it doesn't affect my workflow**==. 


==**IMPORTANT TO READ:**== 
I did not made this notes for the public, I made this notes for myself therefore the notes are made to be understood by me. Expect some messiness, confusing grammar or spelling mistakes.
