## Story Time
I knew I had to find the right note-taking system. I had a problem where I spent most of my time googling the same stuffs over and over again. Storing it in a bookmark was a pain at all as categorizing it turned into a job. I also realized that everything in technology seems to be connected to each other. If I learned a cybersecurity technique that uses python languange and the technique can also be used in networking, then where do I put my notes? Is it in cybersecurity folder, python folder or networking folder? That's where I realized that traditional note taking method will not do me any favor.

Here, I devoted my time on learning how to take notes effectively in which I did so by exploring [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/), [MOC](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6), and [How I Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502).


## Explanations of each tags
My notes takes three stages of writing and I use tags to assign these. 
Specifically these tags are `#fleeting` `#literature` and `#permanent`.

`#fleeting`

-   Basically these are drafts. Snippets from an article/video that I think are interesting.
-   Some of it are unfinished or notes that are still waiting to be reviewed.
-   Most of the time, it's an uncategorized large chunks amount of knowledge

`#literature`

-   Polished version of #fleeting where I organize, remove or highlight words.

`#permanent`

-   Contains only one concise piece of knowledge that are most translated by my own words.
-   It's not only summarization but rather a technique called "[Atomizing Notes](https://neuron.zettel.page/atomic#:~:text=Zettelkasten%20notes%20are%20atomic%20and,idea%20and%20one%20idea%20only.)"

With this, it seems like a long hectic note taking method but here is where [Progressive Summarization](https://fortelabs.co/blog/series/ps/) comes into play. Basically the whole idea of it is to only modify each note by chance. Meaning if I haven't touched the note for so long, then I don't need to do anything at all. It can be safely ignored no matter if the status of note is `#fleeting`. Doesn't matter, the note will stay intact in my system.
