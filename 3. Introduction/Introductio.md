# !! -- UPDATE -- !!

2024 update. I haven't updated this repository as: 
--> **==I have combined my `personal notes` together with my `tech notes`==**

## ?! WHAT CHANGED !?

I've primarily used **PARA now to categorize my notes**. 
Then **a lil bit of zettelkasten** 
- I rarely use fleeting, literature, permanent notes (as I always edit my notes, so no permanent notes)
- I still use the idea of ATOMIC notes (sometimes)

I then use **"`Google Keep`" to store my quick ideas,** 
then refine them weeks or months later when I choose to have time for that.

!! MAJOR CHANGE !!
- I rarely copy paste and store codes now. ChatGPT made it easy to generate and look for one
- Documentations are now easy to find exactly what you're looking for thanks to microsoft copilot, perplexity, etc.. etc...
- Basically a quick `google` or `bing search` gives you the code that you want WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE PROCESS OF note summarizing, note taking, note refining, etc.. etc...

==Please do understand that the notes target audience is== **==ME==**, 
therefore some things might not make sense TO YOU GOOD READER 
and that's okay... some things in life are quite a mystery and full of coagulated complexity of thoughts. Ha! I like those words
