This repository will only be updated every month. Reasons are provided below:
- To prevent any commit conflict issues  
- To avoid the notification spam of those who enabled "watch" on this repo
- Because the repo has now 1500+ commits and I regret commiting every single time because I have a slow internet and it increases the file size of this repo

## Installation Process to be able to use my notes

I recommend installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as that's where I write and personally, I think Obsidian is the best md editor. Otherwise, you can use any markdown editor that supports `hyperlink` feature.

### 3 Step Process of Installing Obsidian

0. Install the app -> https://obsidian.md

2. Download this **repository (repo)** (Google "How to download github repository" Can't be bothered making a tutorial about it)

3. Unzip the downloaded repo file 

4. Launch the app and Click "Open Folder as vault". Choose the downloaded folder of this repo

Why start at 0? [We often start counting at 0](https://skillcrush.com/blog/why-programmers-start-counting-at-zero/)

## Installation Warning (IMPORTANT TO READ)

It will show you a warning whether to trust author (that's me). 

I assure you that no plugins causes harm. Plugins are not written by me and are written by the community therefore open source. 

Check the installed plugins here 
--> `Tech-Notes/.obsidian/plugins`

### I don't trust you!

Fair enough! And that's a good thing to not trust strangers online :D

-> You can choose `Do not trust`, but some minor features might not work, tho it doesn't spawn inconvience.

-> Or just delete the `.obsidian` directory after downloading it. I believe the obsidian app itself will automatically create it for you at startup.
